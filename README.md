# Zepto Product Data Analysis (PostgreSQL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes product-level data from an online grocery platform
(Zepto-style dataset) to understand pricing, discounts, stock availability,
and inventory distribution using PostgreSQL.

The goal is to demonstrate *SQL data analysis skills*, including data
cleaning, exploration, and business-focused analysis.


## Tools 
- PostgreSQL
- pgAdmin
- SQL (CTEs, Aggregations, CASE, GROUP BY)



## Structure
- zepto-sql-data-analysis/
  - README.md
  - zepto_schema.sql
  - zepto_data_exploration.sql
  - zepto_data_cleaning.sql
  - zepto_analysis.sql


## Data Exploration
- Total number of products
- Identification of missing (NULL) values
- Unique product categories
- In-stock vs out-of-stock product count
- Detection of duplicate product names (multiple SKUs)

## Data Cleaning
- Removed products with invalid pricing (MRP = 0)
- Converted prices from paise to rupees
- Ensured consistent numeric formats for analysis

## Key Analysis Performed
- Top 10 best-value products based on discount percentage
- High-MRP products that are currently out of stock
- Estimated revenue per product category
- Products with high price but low discount
- Price-per-gram analysis to identify best value products


## Key Insights
- Certain categories contribute disproportionately to total revenue
- Bulk products generally offer lower price per gram
- High-MRP items are more likely to be out of stock
- Discounts vary significantly across categories
